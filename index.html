            <p>A paragraph is a series of related sentences developing a central idea, called the topic. Try to think
                about
                paragraphs in terms of thematic unity: a paragraph is a sentence or a group of sentences that supports
                one
                central, unified idea. Paragraphs add one idea at a time to your broader argument.</p>
